GIF compressor optimizes GIFs using Gifsicle and Lossy GIF encoder, which implements lossy LZW compression.
It can reduce the animated GIF file size by 30%â€”50% at the cost of some dithering/noise. You can adjust the compression level with a simple slider to get the best result for your use case.
This is the default method and should work for any GIF.
